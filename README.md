# MatchingGame
Udacity FEND Project - Matching Cards Game.


### Game Logic:
- The game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.
- The user can restart the game any time by clicking on the 'rotate' icon.
- When the user wins the game a module appears that displays the following:
    - Total moves made.
    - Total time (in seconds) that took the player to beat the game.
    - Score (3 to 1 stars) depending on the number of moves made.

### Dependancies: None - it's just plain javascript.
